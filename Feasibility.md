<h>Market feasibility</h3>

<h3>Our product:</h3>
Our product is a wishlist that is easy to access and maneuver around. Leaving the user with a good experience. Our product will let the user be able to create one or multiple wishlists with one or multiple wishes. They will be able to share this wishlist with friends, family or anyone they would like, through a link. 

<h3>Problem:</h3>
People want an easy way to keep track of not only your own, but other people's wishes for certain events. A digital wishlist where the wishes our easy to access and purchase fulfills that issue. 

<h3>Market:</h3> 
The market for software as this would be a wide spread. The target audience is everyone who wishes to make a digital wishlist. Digital wish lists are becoming more and more popular for people of all ages, as it's an easier form of keeping track of family members' wishes for a birthday, friends' wishlist for a wedding and so on. As with a lot of new software the target audience at the start of the launch of the product should be the younger generation as they would then spread it to parents and so on. 
It can often be a problem coming up with wishes, which also makes a digital wishlist a desirable thing as they can be used as inspiration for others. 

<h3>Competition:</h3>
There is already competition in this field, as there already is some existing software trying to solve this problem.

<h3>Technical feasibility:</h3>
We are 4 members working on the project. To complete a small scale project as the one we are developing it doesn't require more. We are coding in Java through intelliJ IDEA and using github to overview our progress. We have all the technical resources for the project and a timeframe og 2 weeks to complete the project. After analyzing the project it is technically feasible.
